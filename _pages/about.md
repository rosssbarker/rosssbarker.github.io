I work on answering questions related to the social pressures affecting fertility. These pressures are often difficult to quantify and measure. I approach these questions by using text-based sources and quantitative text analysis while following principles of critical and concerned demography. To do so, I use historical text data from books and newspapers, as well as web-based data. My methodological interests are in computational social science, web scraping, and natural language processing. 

I am interested in the philosophy of science and the role of methodologies, aiming to understand how demographers and social scientists adapt their techniques to create their theories, identify problems, and shape research questions.

I have a BA in Geography from the University of Leeds and an MSc in Demography from the University of Southampton. Prior to joining the LSE, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Vienna Institute of Demography, Austrian Academy of Sciences. During my time there, I researched the uncertainty of fertility, the evolution of fertility intentions throughout life, and the use of mobile phone apps for fertility tracking.
