I am a detail-oriented researcher and data analyst with strong experience in social science research and demographic analysis. I have worked across academic institutions and research organizations, leading projects from initial concept to publication. My skills include advanced coding in R and Python, managing complex cross-national datasets, and applying rigorous methods to extract meaningful insights.

I am passionate about using data to explore social phenomena, particularly around fertility, family formation, and public attitudes—and about communicating findings clearly to both academic and wider audiences. I work well in collaborative, interdisciplinary teams and enjoy combining quantitative analysis with theory-driven interpretation.

I am currently seeking research roles where I can apply my expertise in data analysis, project coordination, and methodological development to contribute to impactful social science research. I’m motivated by the challenge of making complex data accessible and relevant.
